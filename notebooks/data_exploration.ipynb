       "  'abstract': 'Understanding the interactions and interplay of microorganisms is a great challenge with many applications in medical and environmental settings. In this work, we model bacterial communities directly from their genomes using graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs leverage the inductive bias induced by the set nature of bacteria, enforcing permutation invariance and granting combinatorial generalization. We propose to learn the dynamics implicitly by directly predicting community relative abundance profiles at steady state, thus escaping the need for growth curves. On two real-world datasets, we show for the first time generalization to unseen bacteria and different community structures. \\nTo investigate the prediction results more deeply, we created a simulation for flexible data generation and analyze effects of bacteria interaction strength, community size, and training data amount.',\n",

That information is provided in Supplementary information: the graph is fully connected.

The proposed models were tested on  simulated and previous publicly available microbial datasets and compared with the MLP-based implementation to show the effectiveness, with the discussions on the generalizability of GNN-based implementations.',\n",

       "    'weaknesses': '1. The methodological contribution is limited as the presented work is mostly implementing GNNs for microbial steady state predictions. \\n\\n2. The main core of the paper is based on the assumption that if there is a steady state solution to the dynamics of bacterial species, then that steady state can be predicted using the genome data of the species in the system. This is a reasonable assumption to make. However the fact that this method works only for steady state solutions needs to be emphasized. Indeed in the GLV setting in the famous example of foxes and rabbits, there could be steady state and oscillatory solutions even though the participating genomes are foxes and rabbits in both the cases. It might also be a good idea to highlight why authors expect to find (or not) only steady state solutions in systems involving microorganisms such as bacteria. This will add more strength to the paper.\\n\\n3. For simulations, the GLV equations along with initial conditions and parameters $\\\\mu_i, K_i, a_{i,j}$ drawn from different probability density functions are used to generate data. Did all such simulations lead to steady state solutions? Were any simulations that did not lead to steady state solutions discarded? Do the authors also have any comments on the frequency of steady state solutions when random parameters are used?\\n\\n4. Given the GLV equations, the steady state solutions can be found by solving a system of $|S|$ linear algebraic equations:\\n    \\\\begin{equation}\\n        \\\\sum_{j=1}^{|S|}a_{i,j}n_j = K_i.\\n    \\\\end{equation}\\nThe steady state is entirely determined by the parameters $a_{i,j}$ and $K_i$. The authors use a vector composed of $[\\\\mu_i, K_i, \\\\nu_i^s, \\\\nu_i^r, random]$ (where $a_{i,j} \\\\approx \\\\nu_i^s. \\\\nu_j^r$) to simulate the genome data in their simulation. It would be a good idea to highlight that within the simulated genome vector only the components $[K_i, \\\\nu_i^s, \\\\nu_i^r]$ determine the steady state solution.\\n\\n5. The parameter $a_{i,j}$ (broken into two vectors $\\\\nu_i^s, \\\\nu_j^r$ to simulate the genome) contains information on the pairwise interaction between different species. On the other hand, the information in a genome is completely intrinsic to a particular species. The authors should square these two facts.\\n\\n6. A proper simulation would entail simulation of the genome data. The genome data typically do not include information on interaction between species. But for simulations, the interaction matrix was used to derive $\\\\nu$ vectors. The claim of interpretability seems to be questionable. \\n    \\n7. The authors appear to be confused on equivariance and invariance. The permutation invariance justification for using graph neural networks is confusing. For example, GLV models are widely used to model the dynamics of microorganisms. But the GLV model is not permutation invariant. The authors stated \"\\\\textit{When shuffling the order of bacteria within the train and test communities, the accuracy of MLPs drops significantly, clearly showing that the dynamics learned by MLPs are not invariant to permutations...}\" It is to be expected that shuffling the data will lead to reduction in performance of MLP based models. But as long as all the training and testing is done with a particular order of species, it should not matter.\\n\\n8.

       "    'weaknesses': \"While I enjoyed reading something on the outskirts of my experience, although I have grown my own tuberculosis communities in the early days of my research, I struggle with some of the basic premises:\\n* Motivation & Context: The paper's motivation needs clearer alignment with real-world applications. The authors cite that understanding these communities is essential for gut, industry and space but I find the step from this paper to extrapolating to gut seems huge. The largest studied communities are 26 and this needs to be put in context with the other fields, citing Wikipedia “1010 to 1011 cells per gram of intestinal content” seems far off from the estimated single colonies. The types of bacteria should also be matched with the environment that you aim to generalize for.\\n* Sample Size & DNA Inclusion: I'm concerned about the limited independent samples, especially in combination with the attempt to include DNA. Making sense of DNA has proven much more difficult than thought of in the beginning and I’m not convinced that the addition made sense. Adding it to the paper risks of overfitting the data even more. I wonder if the field wouldn’t benefit more from going from 500 samples to 1-2000 more than this paper. My experience with building models on this type of data is that they are frustratingly brittle due to the lack of data.\\n* Clarity & Explanation: Coming from medicin to ML is always a challenge. It would be helpful if the paper could provide clearer explanations for terms and metrics, especially for readers transitioning from medical backgrounds. E.g. keystone bacteria are not explained, good vs acceptable R2 is unclear to the reader (I can’t even find clearly how is this calculated, despite looking in appendix A which I should not have to for the main outcome), I assume that R2 is highly dependent on the underlying complexity, also the datasets have completely different bacteria suggesting that their purpose was different but this is unclear to me despite reading it several times.\\n* Simulation Impact: The paper should provide a clearer explanation of the effect of simulated colonies on the models' stability.\\nRegarding the conclusion I’m a little confused as to why it doesn’t recommend including more data. I believe the authors have devoted significant time to this paper and before we put others down this path, perhaps we should wait for more data or do the authors truly feel that GEMs will be the solution?\",\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Conventional deep learning methods for fault detection often assume that the training and the testing sets share the same fault pattern spaces and domain spaces. However, some fault patterns are rare, and many real-world faults have not appeared in the training set. As a result, it’s hard for the trained model to achieve desirable performance on the testing set. \\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel domain generalization, Load-Domain (LD) domain generalization, which is based on the analysis of the CWRU bearing dataset and its domain division method. For this scenario, we propose a feature shift model called FSN (Feature Shift Network). In the bearing dataset, domains are divided based on different operating conditions which have specific loads, so it’s equivalent to load-based domain division. Moreover, the domain label corresponds to the actual load magnitude, making it unique as it contains physical information, which can boost detection accuracy on unknown domain beyond the training set. According to the knowledge above , FSN is trained for feature shift on adjacent source domains, and finally shifts target domain features into adjacent source domain feature space to achieve the purpose of domain generalization.\\nExtensive experiments on CWRU demonstrate that FSN is better than the existed models in the LD domain generalization case. Furthermore, we have another test on MNIST, which also shows FSN can achieve the best performance.',\n",

       "  {'summary': 'In this paper, the authors introduce a new Load-Domain (LD) domain generalization setting, where the domain label corresponds to actual load magnitude. To serve the scenario, the authors propose a feature shift model (FSN) to learn feature mapping between adjacent domains according to the physical meaning in domain labels. Experiments are carried out on CWRU bearing dataset and rotated MINST datasets to showcase the performance.',\n",
       "   'strengths': '1. The idea of employing the physical meaning of domain labels to achieve generalization on consecutive domains makes sense to me. \\n2. The new setting of LD domain generalization also seems suitable for the benchmark of CWRU dataset, where the physical meaning of domain labels can be clearly defined.',\n",
       "   'weaknesses': '1. The paper’s writing and formatting are not good enough, making it sometimes hard to read and understand. There exist many formatting errors (e.g., the use of spaces in Sections 1 and 2, the math symbol consistency in Section 4.1: P(1) and P^{(K)}). The caption of Figure 1 is duplicated. The abbreviation in Paragraph 3, Section 2 might be RAP. In the second line of paragraph in section “Distribution Law Conjecture”, F_p should be the the mapping relation between features, not labels.\\n2. Besides the ones from 1., the Experiment part (e.g., paragraph 4 in “Classical Model Contrast” part) is hard to understand. Bad formatting and discontinuous sentences make it unreadable to me.\\n3. Key references are absent. In the first paragraph of Section 4.2, methods aligning the three types of distributions should be cited to justify the categorization. The compared methods in “Comparison with Classical Models” should also be referred to, and the Li et al. (2018) reference in this paragraph is wrongly cited, this paper should be “Deep Domain Generalization via Conditional Invariant Adversarial Networks”.\\n4. As to the experimental results, the metric of Table 1 is not clearly stated. Also, the experimental details like backbone choice, learning rate, optimization schedules are not provided.\\n5. The setting is still too limited. The current method and experiments only focus on generalizing from highly relevant and sequential source domains to a target domain close to the last seen source domain. The performance of the proposed method should be further evaluated on broader settings where the relationship of source and target domains is not fixed. Also, the setting seems much relevant to that of Continuous Domain Generalization, which should be discussed.',\n",

       "  {'summary': \"The paper addresses a challenge in deep learning-based fault detection, where real-world faults may not always appear in the training set. This limitation makes it difficult for conventional models to generalize well to unseen fault patterns. To address this, the authors introduce a domain generalization method, Load-Domain (LD) domain generalization, specifically designed based on the CWRU bearing dataset. In this method, the domains are divided based on different operating conditions that have specific loads, which correspond to the actual load magnitude. This inclusion of physical information helps enhance the model's accuracy for unknown domains. The authors propose the Feature Shift Network (FSN), which is trained to shift features between adjacent source domains and the target domain for better generalization. The effectiveness of FSN is shown through experiments on both the CWRU bearing dataset and the MNIST dataset, where FSN outperforms existing methods.\",\n",
       "   'strengths': \"+ The authors tackle a crucial issue in fault detection where conventional models may not perform well on unseen fault patterns.\\n+ This novel domain generalization approach, based on real physical properties (load magnitude), can potentially be more representative and robust than abstract or purely data-driven domain divisions.\\n+ The model's applicability on both the CWRU bearing dataset and the MNIST dataset suggests it is versatile and not limited to one type of data.\\n+ The authors compare their model with classical fault diagnosis methods, showing its superiority in specific scenarios.\\n+ The paper appears to have a well-structured format, with sections dedicated to reviewing the current state of research, introducing their novel domain generalization method, and discussing experimental results.\",\n",
       "   'weaknesses': '- The assumption that domain label corresponds to actual load magnitude might not hold for all real-world scenarios. It may be beneficial to test scenarios where this is not the case.\\n- Introducing domain-specific information like load magnitude could risk overfitting to specific domain characteristics. The generalization capability of the model in truly unseen domains is a concern.',\n",
       "   'questions': \"- How does the Load-Domain (LD) domain generalization approach compare with other domain generalization methods that don't rely on physical information like load magnitude?\\n- Are there potential scenarios where the assumption of domain labels corresponding to actual load magnitude may not hold?
