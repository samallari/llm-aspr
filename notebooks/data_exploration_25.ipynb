However, the quasi-periodic nature of vocal tract sampling often results in inadequate spectral resolution in traditional spectral features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), thereby limiting their classification effectiveness. In this study, we propose the use of Constant Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCC), which leverage geometrically spaced frequency bins to provide superior spectrotemporal resolution, particularly for capturing the fundamental frequency and its harmonics in speech signals associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Our results demonstrate that CQCC, when integrated with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers, significantly outperform MFCC, achieving absolute improvements of 5.6 % and 7.7 %, respectively. Furthermore, CQCC show enhanced performance over traditional acoustic measures, such as Jitter, Shimmer, and Teager Energy. The effectiveness of CQCC is underpinned by the form-invariance property of the Constant Q Transform (CQT), which ensures consistent feature representation across varying pitch and tonal conditions, thereby enhancing classification robustness. Furthermore, the robustness of CQCC features against MFCC features are validated using LDA plots.

Is it absolutely needed to have speech containing sustained vowel to be able to detect/recognize the condition investigated in this work?\\n(2) Table 2 in the dataset section, introduces three datasets: D1, D2 and D3. However it is not clear which one of these correspond to the datasets detailed in section 4.1. Also, in section 4.1, there are two datasets that are introduced: (a) Italian Parkinson’s Voice and Speech dataset, and (b) Minsk2019 ALS database.

What is the rationale behind using 13 MFCCs only? Typically 13 is selected for speech recognition purposes, as higher cepstral coefficients are known to capture more speaker related attributes. \\n\\n(5) Section 5.1 presents an interesting analysis using some examples, however it is not clear that how much of the observations shared in the analysis is captured by the features. Specifically the first 13 cepstral features may not capture speaker specific characteristics, including pitch. It is also not obvious if harmonic energy is captured well in the explored features. \\nHow consistent are these observations w.r.t speakers having varying degrees of ALS or Parkinsons disease?\\n\\n(6) Section 5.2.2 presents an interesting analysis by comparing the findings against other relevant features. However, it will be useful to share if there is any prior art that have proposed the use of these features in isolation?\\nGiven jitter, shimmer and teager energy features, each capture different attributes in the acoustic speech signal, these features are usually used in combination with one another, rather than isolation. It is not clear why these features were explored in isolation as baseline. What happens when these features were combined, even when combined with MFCCs of CQCCs. \\n\\n(7) Section 5.2.2, page 8, lines 385-386: \"Two new databases D1 and D3 were prepared, where two different pathologies ..\" > it is not clear what D1, D2 and D3 represent?

However, even considering the potential contribution in the area of neurodegenerative disorders detection, the comparison proposed in the paper is pretty limited since some previous works have shown that, in the context of PD detection, Rasta-PLP coefficients have better performance than MFCC but more importantly, that sustained vowels lack articulatory information which is critical to the PD detection. Indeed, there are not many datasets available out there, but the Italian Dataset used in the experiments has pretty low recording quality, and many works have shown that classifying PD vs. Control in that dataset is not a difficult task, so it should not be used as a benchmark.',\n",
       "    'questions': \"- Why do the authors consider the paper suitable for the ICLR venue?\\n- The revision of the previous work should be improved significantly; literature using spectral/cepstral features is abundant. Moreover,  to evaluate the proposed approach's actual contribution, the paper should analyse (and compare) the proposed approach with works using end-to-end approaches based on Spectrograms or feature vectors obtained from foundational models, such as Wav2vec, Speech2Vec, or HuBERT.\\n- Why did the authors not include experiments using Rasta-PLP if several works have reported better performance than MFCC in the context of PD detection?\\n- Why did the authors not include experiments using oral diadochokinesis tasks or free speech, which are currently the maximum performance tasks for PD detection from speech signals?\\n- Why did the authors not include more datasets in their experiments, such as the GITA (https://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/fileadmin/research/Publikationen/2014/Orozco14-NSS.pdf) or Neurovoz (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371) datasets, which are provided by request. There are also datasets in German, Czech, and English used in many studies that could be used by requesting the material from the authors.\\n- The authors should include cross-dataset experiments, which are the most challenging evaluations, where most of the proposed approaches fail or show significant drops in their performance, so they constitute the goal standard for evaluating advances in this field of application.\",\n",

The authors did specify that the constant-Q cepstra is the main novelty presented in this work, however that is fairly incremental as such features have been used in speech technologies, perhaps not in the same application area as this article.',\n",

Is it absolutely needed to have speech containing sustained vowel to be able to detect/recognize the condition investigated in this work?\\n(2) Table 2 in the dataset section, introduces three datasets: D1, D2 and D3. However it is not clear which one of these correspond to the datasets detailed in section 4.1. Also, in section 4.1, there are two datasets that are introduced: (a) Italian Parkinson’s Voice and Speech dataset, and (b) Minsk2019 ALS database.

What is the rationale behind using 13 MFCCs only? Typically 13 is selected for speech recognition purposes, as higher cepstral coefficients are known to capture more speaker related attributes. \\n\\n(5) Section 5.1 presents an interesting analysis using some examples, however it is not clear that how much of the observations shared in the analysis is captured by the features. Specifically the first 13 cepstral features may not capture speaker specific characteristics, including pitch. It is also not obvious if harmonic energy is captured well in the explored features. \\nHow consistent are these observations w.r.t speakers having varying degrees of ALS or Parkinsons disease?\\n\\n(6) Section 5.2.2 presents an interesting analysis by comparing the findings against other relevant features. However, it will be useful to share if there is any prior art that have proposed the use of these features in isolation?\\nGiven jitter, shimmer and teager energy features, each capture different attributes in the acoustic speech signal, these features are usually used in combination with one another, rather than isolation. It is not clear why these features were explored in isolation as baseline. What happens when these features were combined, even when combined with MFCCs of CQCCs. \\n\\n(7) Section 5.2.2, page 8, lines 385-386: \"Two new databases D1 and D3 were prepared, where two different pathologies ..\" > it is not clear what D1, D2 and D3 represent?

The experimental setup includes samples from patients suffering from Parkinson-s Disease (PD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The proposed pipeline includes using SMOTE to compensate for class-inbalance problems and two classical ML classification models: SVM and RF. The results show a comparison between CQCC against the well-known MFCC and classical acoustic parameters related to the fundamental frequency variability.',\n",

       "   'weaknesses': 'The main drawback of the paper is its novelty. Moreover, I consider it entirely out of the Conference\\'s scope since it does not introduce any approach incorporating the idea of a \"learning representation.\" The components related to Machine Learning used in the paper are traditional ML models. Regarding its novelty, the set of features analysed in the paper was introduced back in 2017 and has been tested before in several voice/speech processing applications, so its contribution would be more focused on the academic community interested in the specific area of neurodegenerative disorders classification from speech signals. However, even considering the potential contribution in the area of neurodegenerative disorders detection, the comparison proposed in the paper is pretty limited since some previous works have shown that, in the context of PD detection, Rasta-PLP coefficients have better performance than MFCC but more importantly, that sustained vowels lack articulatory information which is critical to the PD detection. Indeed, there are not many datasets available out there, but the Italian Dataset used in the experiments has pretty low recording quality, and many works have shown that classifying PD vs. Control in that dataset is not a difficult task, so it should not be used as a benchmark.',\n",
       "   'questions': \"- Why do the authors consider the paper suitable for the ICLR venue?\\n- The revision of the previous work should be improved significantly; literature using spectral/cepstral features is abundant. Moreover,  to evaluate the proposed approach's actual contribution, the paper should analyse (and compare) the proposed approach with works using end-to-end approaches based on Spectrograms or feature vectors obtained from foundational models, such as Wav2vec, Speech2Vec, or HuBERT.\\n- Why did the authors not include experiments using Rasta-PLP if several works have reported better performance than MFCC in the context of PD detection?\\n- Why did the authors not include experiments using oral diadochokinesis tasks or free speech, which are currently the maximum performance tasks for PD detection from speech signals?\\n- Why did the authors not include more datasets in their experiments, such as the GITA (https://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/fileadmin/research/Publikationen/2014/Orozco14-NSS.pdf) or Neurovoz (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371) datasets, which are provided by request. There are also datasets in German, Czech, and English used in many studies that could be used by requesting the material from the authors.\\n- The authors should include cross-dataset experiments, which are the most challenging evaluations, where most of the proposed approaches fail or show significant drops in their performance, so they constitute the goal standard for evaluating advances in this field of application.\",\n",
