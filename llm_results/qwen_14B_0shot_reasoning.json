      "model_response": "<reasoning>\n1. **Review Analysis**:\n   - Review 1: Mixed sentiment, leaning towards acceptance with minor concerns about L2 regularization testing and mask change frequency.\n   - Review 2: Borderline, with significant concerns about whether BiDST is truly sparse training, the approximation of bi-level optimization, and the fairness of comparisons.\n   - Review 3: Mixed sentiment, with concerns about the lack of convergence guarantees and the naturalness of the upper-level objective.\n\n2. **Key Strengths**:\n   - The paper provides a clear connection between DST and bi-level optimization, offering a novel perspective on the problem.\n   - BiDST demonstrates strong empirical performance, achieving higher accuracy and faster execution speeds compared to existing DST methods.\n   - The experimental setup is thorough, covering multiple datasets and sparsity levels.\n\n3. **Critical Weaknesses & Severity**:\n   - **Severity of Issues**:\n     - **Mask Learning and Sparsity**: Review 2 raises significant doubts about whether BiDST is truly performing sparse training or dense training due to the use of Gumbel-Softmax. This is a critical issue as it questions the validity of the method's core premise.\n     - **Approximation of Bi-Level Optimization**: The simplification of the bi-level optimization by discarding second-order partial derivatives is questioned by Review 2 and Review 3. This could impact the effectiveness of the optimization.\n     - **Convergence Guarantees**: Lack of theoretical guarantees for convergence is noted by Review 3, which is a major concern for a new optimization method.\n     - **Fairness of Comparisons**: Review 2 highlights potential unfair comparisons due to differences in training epochs and overhead costs, which could affect the reliability of the results.\n\n4. **Conflict Resolution**:\n   - The primary conflict revolves around whether BiDST is truly sparse training. Review 2\u2019s concerns are particularly compelling as they challenge the fundamental assumptions of the method.\n   - The approximation of bi-level optimization and lack of convergence guarantees are also significant, but they are more about the robustness and theoretical soundness rather than the practical applicability of the method.\n\n5. **Final Verdict Formulation**:\n   - While the paper presents a novel and potentially impactful approach, the unresolved issues regarding the nature of the training (sparse vs. dense) and the lack of theoretical guarantees significantly undermine the credibility of the method.\n   - The empirical results are impressive, but without addressing the core concerns raised by the reviewers, the paper falls short of meeting the rigorous standards required for acceptance.\n\n</reasoning>\n<decision>\nREJECT\n</decision>",
